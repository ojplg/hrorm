<p>
    Hrorm provides a mechanism for building {@link org.hrorm.Dao} objects.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm <code>Dao</code> objects support
    basic CRUD operations on a relational (SQL) database: <code>insert</code>,
    <code>select</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <code>Dao</code> objects are created by using a {@link org.hrorm.DaoBuilder} or
    {@link org.hrorm.IndirectDaoBuilder}. These classes
    provide a simple, declarative, fluent interface for describing the relationship between
    the Java object to be persisted and the underlying schema that supports it.
</p>

<p>
    While almost all the classes and methods in this package are public, there is little need to
    use them directly. Other than the <code>DaoBuilder</code>, <code>IndirectDaoBuilder</code>,
    <code>Dao</code>, <code>Converter</code>, <code>Transactor</code> and <code>HrormException</code>
    most clients should not have to directly reference anything in this package.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm intentionally converts all checked <code>SQLException</code> instances that arise to
    <code>HrormException</code> which extends <code>RuntimeException</code> in its
    client interfaces. Of course,
    proper exception handling is essential to a sound persistence policy in an application,
    regardless of whether the particular exceptions are checked or unchecked.
