    In an <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/introducing-hrorm-a-simple-declarative-type-checke">earlier article</a>
    I introduced <a href="https://hrorm.org">Hrorm</a>, a simple, declarative, type-checked library for building DAOs.
    Hrorm is an ORM tool condensed
    down to its essence: making SQL queries against an RDBMS and translating their results into objects. The first article
    was about why a new ORM tool was worthwhile, even when we already have many options. If that was the introduction
    to Hrorm, this is Chapter One: how to use the basics.
</p>

<h4>Preliminaries</h4>

<p>
    Before using any development tool, there are a number of things that have to be done: getting it, installing it,
    configuring it, getting its dependencies (and resolving dependency conflicts), etc. In the Java world, Maven
    has taken care of a lot of that for us, and of course you can get Hrorm via Maven. Of course, you can also just download
    the jar file and put it in your classpath using whatever means you wish.
</p>

<p>
    The most difficult part of setting up Hrorm is setting up your JDBC provider. This is beyond the scope of
    this article, since that varies from database to database.
    But once you have done that, and can create a <code>java.sql.Connection</code> to your
    datastore, Hrorm is ready to go. Hrorm is a single jar, it just needs to be in your classpath. Hrorm has no
    dependencies: it just uses the Java standard libraries. Hrorm requires no container, no configuration,
    and since it uses the JDBC interfaces and ANSI SQL, there is no per-database customization. Moreover,
    Hrorm works with plain Java objects: it does not require your object model contain any Hrorm
    code, annotations, or implement any of its interfaces.
</p>

<h4>Example Model</h4>

<p>
    For the rest of this article, I will be talking about a simple entity model. Here's the Java, with getters and
    setters omitted (though some accessors are required, Hrorm does not use reflection and especially not
    <code>sun.misc.Unsafe</code>):
</p>

<pre>
    class Product {
        private Long id;
        private String name;
        private ProductCategory category;
        private BigDecimal price;
        private long sku;
        private boolean discontinued;
        private LocalDateTime firstAvailable;
    }

    enum ProductCategory {
        Kitchen,Clothing,Electronic,Miscellaneous
    }
</pre>

<p>
    And here's the SQL schema.
</p>

<pre>
    create sequence products_sequence;

    create table products (
        id integer PRIMARY KEY,
        name text,
        category text,
        price decimal,
        sku integer,
        discontinued boolean,
        first_available timestamp
    );
</pre>

<p>
    As is often the case with examples of this type, it's a bit silly and artificial, but it will
    highlight a number of the basic features of Hrorm.
</p>

<h4>Defining an Entity in Hrorm</h4>

<p>
    To manage persistence of an entity using Hrorm we first create a <code>DaoBuilder</code>.
    A <code>DaoBuilder</code> uses a fluent, declarative interface to describe the entity's
    database schema and Java object model allowing Hrorm to do persistence tasks.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the mapping we will need will be straight-forward, but there is one detail that
    will require some preliminaries. Because the Java object model contains a custom enumerated
    type and the database contains a string, we need to implement a simple interface,
    <code>org.hrorm.Converter&lt;CLASS, CODE&gt;</code>, that will handle the
    translation to and from a <code>String</code> and the enumerated type. The
    implementation is trivial and shown below.
</p>

<pre>
    class CategoryConverter implements Converter&lt;ProductCategory, String&gt; {
        @Override
        public String from(ProductCategory item) {
            return item.toString();
        }

        @Override
        public ProductCategory to(String aString) {
            return ProductCategory.valueOf(aString);
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
    The other types are directly supported. The <code>DaoBuilder</code> looks like this.
</p>

<pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Product&gt; productDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("products", Product::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("id", "products_sequence", Product::getId, Product::setId)
            .withStringColumn("name", Product::getName, Product::setName)
            .withConvertingStringColumn("category", Product::getCategory, Product::setCategory, new CategoryConverter())
            .withBigDecimalColumn("price", Product::getPrice, Product::setPrice)
            .withIntegerColumn("sku", Product::getSku, Product::setSku)
            .withBooleanColumn("discontinued", Product::isDiscontinued, Product::setDiscontinued)
            .withLocalDateTimeColumn("first_available", Product::getFirstAvailable, Product::setFirstAvailable);
</pre>

<p>
    The <code>DaoBuilder</code> is constructed with the name of the underlying table, and the
    a function reference to the constructor of the Java object.
    (Hrorm also supports a mechanism for immutable objects without
    no argument constructors, and you can read more about that in the
    <a href="https://hrorm.org/documentation/latest/#immutable_models">hrorm documentation</a>.)
</p>

<p>
    The next line defines the primary key of the object, including the name of the column,
    the name of the sequence that will populate it, and the getter and setter for the primary key.
    The remaining lines define what column names correspond with the getters and
    setters on the Java object. The correct types must be used. The <code>ProductCategory</code>
    also includes an instance of the converter shown above.
</p>

<h4>Using Hrorm</h4>

<p>
    This is all the set up Hrorm needs to manage persistence of a <code>Product</code> object.
    As the name implies, a <code>DaoBuilder</code> is used to build actual <code>Dao</code>
    objects. To do this, we need one other thing: a <code>java.sql.Connection</code> object,
    as provided by the JDBC implementation of whatever database being used. Up until now,
    we have been working for Hrorm, but now Hrorm will start working for us.
</p>

<pre>
    Connection connection = // somehow we get the connection from the JDBC
    Dao&lt;Product&gt; productDao = productDaoBuilder.buildDao(connection);
</pre>

<p>
    Our first job is to persist an instance of a product. We create a new instance
    of the <code>Product</code> object, without setting the primary key <code>id</code> field. We
    pass that to the <code>Dao.insert()</code> method. The insert method will do several
    things.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>It will select a new value from the <code>products_sequence</code> in the database.</li>
    <li>It will run SQL on a prepared statement in the database that looks like
        <code>INSERT INTO PRODUCTS (ID, NAME, ...) VALUES ( ... )</code>.</li>
    <li>It will set the value of the new primary key onto the <code>Product</code> object.</li>
</ol>

<pre>
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setName("Chef Knife");
    product.setCategory(ProductCategory.Kitchen);
    product.setPrice(new BigDecimal("99.95"));
    product.setSku(12345L);
    product.setDiscontinued(false);
    product.setFirstAvailable(LocalDateTime.of(2017, 6, 15, 0, 0));

    long chefKnifeId = dao.insert(product);

    connection.commit();
</pre>

<p>Note that Hrorm does not take responsibility for when to commit. It leaves that up to you,
since the application knows what has to be a transaction, but Hrorm does not.</p>

<p>Later on, when the product goes on sale, we can load it up, set the new price, and
issue an update.</p>

<pre>
    Product chefKnife = productDao.select(chefKnifeId);
    chefKnife.setPrice(new BigDecimal("59.95"));

    productDao.update(chefKnife);

    connection.commit();
</pre>

<p>
    Hrorm does not do any state tracking or try to issue optimized SQL. When the
    <code>Dao.update()</code> method is called, it will update all the fields in
    the database for the record with the primary key matching the object.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm also supports a <code>delete</code> method, that issues <code>DELETE</code> SQL for the particular
    record.
</p>

<h4>Various Selects</h4>

<p>
    The methods to insert, update, and delete records are quite straightforward, and there is
    little to add to what was said above. The case of select is a bit more complicated. We have
    already seen one <code>select</code> method above, when a single record was pulled from
    the database by its primary key. But Hrorm supports a variety of mechanisms for doing
    selects.
</p>

<p>
    First up, a way to select matching records for some template object.
    The idea here is to create an instance of the entity class, populated
    with some values, and then instruct Hrorm to find the matching records
    by some subset of the table columns.
    For instance, if we wanted to find all the electronic
    products that are discontinued, we could write code like this.
</p>

<pre>
    Dao&lt;Product&gt; productDao = productDaoBuilder.buildDao(connection);

    Product template = new Product();
    template.setCategory(ProductCategory.Electronic);
    template.setDiscontinued(true);

    List&lt;Product&gt; products = productDao.selectManyByColumns(template, "category", "discontinued");
</pre>

<p>
    This is a useful mechanism when you have an object instance that you want to match,
    but it is not the most generic method that Hrorm makes available. Selecting by columns
    only allows for checking for equality of values. Using Hrorm's <code>Where</code>
    objects makes it possible to write much more general queries.
</p>

<p>
    Let's say we wanted to find all the 'Miscellaneous' products that cost less
    than $100 and were introduced in 2018. Using a <code>Where</code> object will
    allow us to construct the query we need as follows.
</p>

<pre>
    List&lt;Product&gt; products = productDao.select(
        new Where("category", Operator.EQUALS, ProductCategory.Miscellaneous.toString())
                .and("price", Operator.LESS_THAN, new BigDecimal("100.00"))
                .and("first_available", Operator.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS, LocalDateTime.of(2018,1,1,0,0))
                .and("first_available", Operator.LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, LocalDateTime.of(2018,12,31,23,59)));
</pre>

<p>
    A Hrorm <code>Where</code> object is a (possibly nested) collection of predicates on
    the columns. Using the <code>org.hrorm.Operator</code> class we describe what test to use
    for the given value. Predicates are joined using either the <code>or</code> or the <code>and</code>
    methods.
</p>

<p>
    The mechanisms shown above will always result in the construction of a list of objects equal
    to the size of the result set. If you wish to run a query and make a computation on the results
    without ever instantiating all the results in one big list, you can use the <code>Dao.foldingSelect()</code>
    method. If you are not familiar with folding, think of the <code>java.util.Stream.reduce()</code>
    methods. The idea is to provide a function that acts as an accumulator and it will pass
    over each value in the result set in turn, but only use the result for its calculation, not
    keep it around in memory.
</p>

<p>
    The following example would compute the total of all the prices of all the discontinued items.
    (Admittedly, this example is ridiculous, why would you ever do this? But the point is to show
    the API in the simplest way.)
</p>

<pre>
    BigDecimal accumulatedPrice = productDao.foldingSelect(
            new BigDecimal(0),
            (accumulatedCost, product) -> accumulatedCost.add(product.getPrice()),
            new Where("discontinued", Operator.EQUALS, false));
</pre>

<p>The above example is silly in real terms, but it's also silly because it could be accomplished
more simply by running a function within SQL.</p>

<pre>
    BigDecimal accumulatedPrice = productDao.runBigDecimalFunction(
            SqlFunction.SUM,
            "price",
            new Where("discontinued", Operator.EQUALS, false));
</pre>

<p>
    There are several other details that you can learn about by reading the Hrorm documentation
    and Javadocs, but the above examples give you a good idea of the abilities Hrorm presents.
    After defining a <code>DaoBuilder</code> in about 8 lines of code, Hrorm provides a decent
    toolkit for doing CRUD operations, and never requires us to write SQL or parse a
    <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code>. Everything is done in a fluent, expressive idiom.
</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>

<p>
    The above gives the flavor of how you use Hrorm to do basic CRUD operations on a simple
    model backed by one table. But the purpose of an RDBMS is to manage <em>relations.</em>
    In the final article, I will describe how to use Hrorm to model complex entities
    that have relationships. If you just cannot wait, you can read the
    <a href="https://hrorm.org/documentation/latest/#relationships">documentation</a>
    today.
