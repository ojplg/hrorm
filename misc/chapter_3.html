    In the Java world, the hardest part of selecting tools can be the
    over-abundance of choices. There's something ridiculous about writing
    a new object relational mapping library. There are already a large
    number of choices, including the Java Persistence API,
    now part of the standard library.
</p>

<p>
    When I started a new project last year, I could not find what I wanted.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>SQL generation</li>
    <li>Declarative, type-checked API</li>
    <li>Simple API for CRUD operations directly on my object model</li>
</ul>

<p>
    And a list of things I did not want.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>External configuration or containers</li>
    <li>Caching, threading, or laziness</li>
    <li>Reflection, unsafe code</li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are probably seven libraries out there that could have sufficed, but
    I started writing my own persistence layer for my project, and that
    became a library, and that became Hrorm.
</p>

<p>
    Building a library for public release makes you think about some design
    questions.
</p>

<h4>Meta-Programming</h4>

<p>
    Some languages (Lisps, Ocaml, Ruby) embrace meta-programming. Others have more
    grudging support (C with it's macros). Others are a bit schizophrenic (Haskell
    versus Template Haskell). I would put Java in the grudging support category.
    Reflection exists, and has for a long time. But it's clumsy and leads to code
    that is unexpressive and unintuitive.
</p>

<p>
    For certain kinds of libraries, reflection is an essential part of the architecture.
    Many go further and use <code>sun.misc.Unsafe</code>. I get nervous when my tools are
    using the features of unsafe. I want my objects to be constructed using my methods, so
    that the invariants I establish are obeyed. It's nothing to worry too much over, but
    I prefer to stick with simpler code.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, since Java 8, and the introduction of things that look like function
    pointers, just using the language without any meta-programming got a lot easier.

    TOPICS:
    * Dao builder: interface clarity versus sharing code, problems with inheritance
    * Dependencies and logging
    * Frameworks versus libraries
    * meta-programming, annotations and reflection (unsafe)
    * lack of type-checking for where clauses
    * Lack of optimization (Hrorm is really slow)
    * packages/namespacing
    * What basic Java types are supported
    * Jobs to do:
        * Generate SQL - should be efficient (i.e. joins)
        * Build objects from result sets
        * Manage resources properly, closing things
