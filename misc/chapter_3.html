    In the Java world, the hardest part of selecting tools can be the
    over-abundance of choices. There's something ridiculous about writing
    a new object relational mapping library. There are already a large
    number of choices, including the Java Persistence API,
    now part of the standard library.
</p>

<p>
    When I started a new project last year, I could not find what I wanted.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>SQL generation</li>
    <li>Declarative, type-checked API</li>
    <li>Simple API for CRUD operations directly on my object model</li>
</ul>

<p>
    And a list of things I did not want.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>External configuration or containers</li>
    <li>Caching, threading, or laziness</li>
    <li>Reflection, unsafe code</li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are probably seven libraries out there that could have sufficed, but
    I started writing my own persistence layer for my project, and that
    became a library, and that became Hrorm.
</p>

<p>
    Building a library for public release makes you think about some design
    questions.
</p>

<h3>The Work of Persistence</h3>

<p>
    To manage the persistence of objects in an RDBMS requires doing a few things.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Decomposing an object into its atoms (strings, numbers, timestamps, etc)</li>
    <li>Generating SQL statements</li>
    <li>Taking the decomposed parts and inserting them into the SQL</li>
    <li>Parsing results from the database</li>
    <li>Recomposing objects from their constituents</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Composing and decomposing objects can be done using getters and setters,
    or builder objects in the case of immutable models. SQL can be easily
    created through simple string manipulation, since there is a limited
    universe of statements to create, and generation is so much simpler
    than parsing. The biggest challenge in parsing result sets is making
    sure to correctly alias and prefix column names when doing joins.
    Mostly, the tasks of doing persistence are a matter of careful accounting
    rather than clever programming.
</p>

<p>
    There's a bit of a hidden problem that is only referenced above: classes
    are not just made of atomic parts that directly decompose into atomic parts.
    They are made up of other objects. But really, this mostly adds another
    layer of accounting. It's not like things suddenly went NP on us.
</p>

<h3>Meta-Programming</h3>

<p>
    Some languages (Lisps, Ocaml, Ruby) embrace meta-progmramming. Others have more
    grudging support (C with it's macros). Others are a bit schizoophrenic (Haskell
    versus Template Haskell). I would put Java in the grudging support category.
    Reflection exists, and has for a long time. But it's clumsy and leads to code
    that is unexpressive and unintuitive.
</p>

<p>
    For certain kinds of libraries, reflection is an essential part of the architecture.
    Many go further and use <code>sun.misc.Unsafe</code>. I get nervous when my tools are
    using the features of unsafe. I want my objects to be constructed using my methods, so
    that the invariants I establish are obeyed. It's nothing to worry too much over, but
    I prefer to stick with simpler code.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, since Java 8, and the introduction of things that look like function
    pointers, just using the language without any meta-programming got a lot easier.
</p>

<h3>Libraries and Frameworks</h3>

<p>
    As an application I prefer libraries to frameworks. I won't try to formally
    distinguish between the two, but I think most programmers have some idea about
    the distinction I am making. Libraries are imported by putting a jar file
    in your classpath; they give you objects and methods; they define interfaces
    and then provide implementations of them. Frameworks require set-up and
    configuration and containers. They have interfaces they expect you to
    to implement. They start up threads and start doing work before you even call
    them.
</p>

<p>
    That's perhaps unfair, and some frameworks are terrific, but I like using libraries
    better. If something is going to venture into framework territory, it better give
    me something valuable for the added compexity they bring.
</p>

<h3>Cleverness</h3>

<p>
    One of my favorite programming aphorisms is Brian Kernighan's thoughts on debugging:
    "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
    Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are,
    by definition, not smart enough to debug it." My corollary to his theorem is
    that you are twice as stupid at two in the morning when called by the operations
    team than you are during the work day. And therefore, if you have to debug
    clever code at two in the morning, you are 4 times stupider than you need to be.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm is not a library that is built to impress when you are fully caffeinated and
    relaxing in the post-doughnut mid-morning surfing session on your dual 30 inch
    monitors. It's built for the dead of night when you're trying to sleep one off
    and you don't want to figure out why a lazy sequence cannot be realized, or
    why a cache has over a billion entries when there are only a million records in
    the database.
</p>

<p>
    When you call one of hrorm's methods, it does something pretty simple. It generates
    some SQL, it passes it along a <code>Connection</code>, and it parses the results
    into your object model, calling methods that you defined.
</p>

<h3>Libraries and Applications</h3>

<p>
    Generalizing wildly, there are two kinds of programmers: those that work on applications
    and those that work on libraries. Application developers' work will be judged overwhelmingly
    by application users on one criteria: does the application do what I want it to reliably
    and without undue fuss. Library writers are judged by muddier criteria. Clearly, some
    libraries become more popular than others (just as some applications do, and I would not
    say that an application's popularity is strictly proportional to its quality), but when
    programmers pick a library, they weigh more criteria more heavily than application consumers do.
    What are they looking for?
</p>

<h3>Ease of use versus ease of implementation</h3>

<p>
    When I wrote hrorm, it was very important to me that users (like me) be able to write code
    like this:
</p>

<pre>
DaoBuilder&lt;Item&gt; = new DaoBuilder&&lt;&gt;("item_table",Item::new)
        .withPrimaryKey( ... )
        .withStringColumn( ... );</pre>

<p>
    What are the implications of that requirement, from a Java language perspective?
    First of all, it means <code>DaoBuilder</code> cannot be an interface or an abstract
    class. The code instantiates an instance of one, so it has to be an object. This is in
    no way a functional requirement on hrorm, and it's easy to imagine a way that it could
    be different: <code>DaoBuilder</code> could be an interface, and you could instantiate
    a <code>SimpleDaoBuilder</code>, or numerous other alternatives. But it was very important
    to me that it work exactly as shown. Partly because I think it makes looking at hrorm
    for the very first time easier. Partly just because I think it reads better. But there's
    a bigger issue lurking: if <code>DaoBuilder</code> is an interface, and there are
    multiple implementations (and eventually, hrorm came to support more than one way to
    build a <code>Dao</code>), the different implementations cannot support different methods
    and still provide a fluent interface: each <code>withSomething()</code> method will
    return the lowest common denominator interface type, and then users can only call methods
    on that interface, not any specialty methods the different implementations provide.
</p>

<p>
    Because of this, the multiple mechanisms for building a <code>Dao</code> in hrorm are
    largely independent, with a lot of cut-and-pasted code and documentation that is
    irritating and error prone to maintain.
</p>

<p>
    We can perhaps imagine some new language (let's call it Jaskell) that gets around this
    problem that allows us to write code like this:
</p>

<pre>
interface DaoBuilder&lt;T&gt; a {
    buildDao : a -> Connection -> T;
    withColumn : a -> String -> (T -> String) -> (T -> String -> ()) -> a;
}</pre>

<p>
    I won't bother to explain what that might mean, since it's both theoretical and a monstrosity.
    And beside the point anyway, since this whole issue is self-imposed. If I could let go
    of the unimportant requirement that a user's first exposure to hrorm look exactly one
    particular way, the code could be simplified. But somehow, I have in my mind the declarative,
    fluent interface that hrorm provides. As long as I want to provide that, I am stuck with
    maintaining the code as it is. My hope is that the ease-of-use for clients outweighs the
    annoyance of implementation to me and other hrorm contributors.
</p>

<h3>More on the type checker</h3>

<p>
    To use hrorm, the application developer must provide it with two things: information
    about the Java object model and data about the SQL schema. The object model is clearly
    the easier one for hrorm to deal with: it's in hrorm's language. The SQL schema is not,
    it's just a bunch of strings.
</p>

<p>
    That's annoying for users since you would like to define the name of the column once,
    just as you define a constant once, and then always have the benefit of the compiler
    to make sure you are refering to it correctly. (You can just make constants for all
    your column names, of course, but now you're doing extra work, not having work
    done for you.) The reason you want to refer to columns more than once is in building
    where clauses, like this.
</p>

<pre>
    Dao&lt;Item&gt; dao = // comes from something
    List&lt;Item&gt; = dao.select(where("COLUMN_A", EQUALS, "Foo")
                                   .and("COLUMN_B" GREATER_THAN, 7L));</pre>

<p>
    There are really two problems here. The first is that the name of the column might
    be wrong: "COLUMNA" instead of "COLUMN_A". The second is that the type of the
    column might be wrong: using an illegal comparison, like comparing a string to an
    integer. When creating a hrorm <code>Dao</code>, the user has already defined
    the name and something about the type of the column, it would be nice to make
    use of it, but I do not see how, except by some form of code generation which
    adds a huge overhead to using hrorm.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm does use one trick to somewhat mitigate the type problem, though not
    the mis-spelled column name problem. It has methods to select that are based
    on passing an instance of the object itself to the method on the DAO. An object
    is initialized with some of its values set, and a list of objects is returned
    that match the specified values on the specified columns. That way, the types
    of the values have to be correct, and of the types that hrorm knows about,
    but of course, the column names can still be wrong.

    TOPICS:
    * Dao builder: interface clarity versus sharing code, problems with inheritance
    * Dependencies and logging
    * Frameworks versus libraries
    * meta-programming, annotations and reflection (unsafe)
    * lack of type-checking for where clauses
    * Lack of optimization (Hrorm is really slow)
    * packages/namespacing
    * What basic Java types are supported
    * Jobs to do:
        * Generate SQL - should be efficient (i.e. joins)
        * Build objects from result sets
        * Manage resources properly, closing things
