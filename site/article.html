    * introduction/critique of ORM tools
    * simple demonstration of hrorm
    * statement of what restrictions hrorm imposes
    * why that doesn't matter too much for many projects
</p>

<p>A lot of cyber ink has been spilled about the problem of connecting the models in Java code
with models in relational (SQL) databases. The topic of object relational mappings (ORMs), is
indeed rich and the full scope of things you might want to do to transfer information between
an application and a database is enormous. Many ORM tools attempt to cover as much of that
space as they possibly can: their designs and implementations provide for a great deal of
flexibility and they are packed with features.</p>

<p>Of course, to achieve that power and flexibility, they are burdened with complexity. This
is not their fault: Java and SQL are quite different worlds and covering all (or even many) the ways to
pull them together is intrisically complex. What about a different approach? What if instead
of designing an ORM tool to handle a wide variety of object and schema models and all
the accompanying use-cases, an ORM tool was designed with some assumptions in mind
about how objects and schemas look and work and how they are used? How simple could an
ORM tool be?</p>

<p>For many projects, a domain model of Java-bean like classes can be backed with a store
of tables one-to-one. For projects like that the primary job of an ORM is as a substitute
to writing tedious boilerplate code manipulating the JDBC interfaces. Such code is very
repetitive to write, boring to maintain, and irritating to debug since the problems usually
boil down to cut-and-paste problems or off-by-one errors when counting question marks in
prepared statements.</p>

<p>Hrorm is a library that exists to make it easy to create data access objects (DAOs) that
can perform the basic CRUD operations for Java-bean like classes. It has some restrictions
on how your object model and schema are designed and it won't do everything you can possibly
want when communicating from your application to your database, but you won't have to
invest in a library of O'Reilly books to use it.</p>

<p>Hrorm allows the easy creation of <code>Dao&lt;T&gt;</code> objects, which allow
you to insert, select, update, and delete instances of type <code>T</code>. To create
a Dao object, you use the DaoBuilder class, which provides a declarative, fluent
interface for describing the relationship between a database schema and a Java
object model. It looks like this.</p>

<pre>
DaoBuilder&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredientDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("INGREDIENT", Ingredient::new)
.withPrimaryKey("ID", "INGREDIENT_SEQUENCE", Ingredient::getId, Ingredient::setId)
.withParentColumn("RECIPE_ID")
.withStringColumn("NAME", Ingredient::getName, Ingredient::setName)
.withIntegerColumn("AMOUNT", Ingredient::getAmount, Ingredient::setAmount);
</pre>

<p>Using a DaoBuilder and a java.sql.Connection object, you can create a <code>Dao</code>,
like this.</p>

<pre>
Dao&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredientDao = ingredientDaoBuilder.build(connection);
</pre>

<p>The <code>Dao&lt;T&gt;</code> interface has methods for doing the standard CRUD operations
<code>insert()</code>, <code>update()</code>, and <code>delete()</code> that
act on objects of type <code>T</code>. In addition, there are a variety of <code>select()</code>
methods for reading data from the database that return individual <code>T</code>
instances or <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>


<h4>The JDBC</h4>

<p>The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API defines how almost all interactions between
relational databases and Java applications happen. Database makers provide and implementation
of the interfaces defined in the java.sql package and clients can do a great many
database tasks through those interfaces, short of actually starting the database.</p>

<p>In greatly over-simplified terms, the JDBC defines three interfaces:
<code>java.sql.Connection</code>,
<code>java.sql.Statement</code>, and <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code>. A
<code>Connection</code> represents a pipe or socket between the application
and the database engine. Messages can be passed through the pipe and responses
read. The <code>Statement</code> is a way to pass a chunk of SQL to the database.
The <code>ResultSet</code> is essentially a two dimensional array representing
results from the database. On one dimenstion, the the <code>ResultSet</code>
is an iterator through returned records or rows, on the other dimension,
the <code>ResultSet</code> provides accessors to retrieve atomic values
from the database record by column name.</p>

<p>The JDBC is a low-level interface, but it actually specifies very little of
how applications and databases interact, since it takes no position on what form
the SQL being sent to the database takes. You can use the JDBC to send arbitrary
strings of SQL to the database. It is entirely up to the database to parse and
execute it, assuming it is SQL. So, databases that provide quite different dialects
of SQL with wildly varying extensions are all supported by the JDBC, so long
as they conform to the basic pattern of accepting queries as strings of SQL
and responding with tabular data.</p>

<p>Depending on how you look at it this makes the JDBC tremendously powerful
(you can do almost anything) or terribly anemic (the abstractions are not suitable
for high-level programming). In theory though, simply by using the JDBC interfaces
almost any interaction a Java application needs to have with a relational database
can be managed. It just might take a lot of repetitive code to get there.</p>

<p>The repetitive nature of the code cannot be over-stated. First, you have
to write all the SQL, generally as literal strings, and SQL is not the most
terse language for this job. The selects, inserts, updates, and deletes all
have to be written to some extent separately. Then each must be passed down
a <code>Connection</code> within a <code>Statement</code> and the <code>ResultSet</code>
    (if relevant)
handled slightly differently. And that is before one gets to the issue of multiple
selects, the joins one might want, etc. Then the results must be parsed into
the applications object model. Throughout this, care must be taken to correctly
release resources lest the database run out of connections or cursors or what
have you. And of course, even the <code>close()</code> methods all throw
the checked <code>SQLException</code>, so everything has to be wrapped in,
possibly nested, try-catch-finally blocks.</p>

<p>It's tedious code to write and inevitably cut-and-paste errors or worse end up
in anyone's work.</p>

<h4>ORMs</h4>

<p>One of the primary reasons to use an ORM is simply to avoid writing and maintaining all the
boilerplate code that directly using the JDBC requires.</p>

<p>The JDBC is a direct modeling of database concepts as Java classes
and interfaces. The code that results is therefore somewhat stilted, in
addition to being quite verbose. One approach to improving matters is
to provide a more modern, idiomatic set of classes for clients to use.
Libraries like JDBI take this approach. Everything is still in the application
developer's hands, in fact, the JDBI webpage claims it is not an ORM since
it does not provide for caching or state tracking and the like. It still requires
developers to write SQL themselves. It greatly diminishes the amount of code
applications contain compared with raw JDBC though.</p>


<p>Library-like things provide classes and methods that client code can instantiate
and call. Frameworks require configuration in languages outside of Java, launch
background threads or require runtime containers.</p>
