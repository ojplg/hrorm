                <hr>

                <p>Horm is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Java.
                    Hrorm is a concise, declarative, type-checked library for the creation of Data Access Objects (DAOs).
                    Hrorm has no external configuration or dependencies.</p>

                <p>Hrorm exists to reduce the amount of boilerplate code (in both Java and SQL) you have to write to
                    manage persistence of Java objects to a relational (SQL) data store without inflicting you
                    with XMLosis or annotationitis.</p>

                <p>The hrorm <a href="/javadocs/latest/org/hrorm/DaoBuilder.html"><code>DaoBuilder</code></a>
                    class provides methods to describe the relationship between an object and its backing table. Once your
                    <code>DaoBuilder</code> objects are defined and you have a database <code>Connection</code>, you can
                    create <a href="/javadocs/latest/org/hrorm/Dao.html"><code>Dao</code></a> objects
                    for performing CRUD operations.</p>

                <p>Hrorm is enormously opinionated about how Java object models and SQL schemas should be designed. It will
                    not play well with many schemas and object models. If you want freedom, look elsewhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card fluid">

                <a name="quick_start"></a>
                <h2>Quick Start</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Suppose you are working on a program for managing recipes that has a domain model that looks like
                    this.</p>

                <pre>
    class Author {
        Long id;
        String name;
    }

    class Recipe {
        Long id;
        String name;
        Author author;
        List&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredients;
    }

    class Ingredient {
        Long id;
        String name;
        long amount;
    }
</pre>

                <p>You might ask yourself: how will I persist such a rich, complex model? And you might think ...
                    I know, I'll put everything into a <code>List</code> and call <code>serialize()</code>
                    and write that to a file on disk.
                    How many recipes and simultaneous users are we expecting to support anyway?
                </p>

                <p>But instead, you come up with the following relational schema.</p>

                <img src="recipe_schema.png" height="384" width="576">

                <p>Because you are the absolute Empress of Overkill.</p>

                <p>Some might think to use <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> or
                    <a href="http://www.mybatis.org/mybatis-3/">Mybatis</a> or something, but no, you
                    are a real glutton for punishment, so you decide to use hrorm and write some code like this,
                    which defines in terms of hrorm <code>DaoBuilder</code> objects the relationship
                    between the database schema and the Java object model.</p>

                <div class="disclaimer" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p>
                        <small>Disclaimer: Yeah, I assume that your schema has some sequences that are not in the
                            picture above. Also, you should have created getters and setters for all of the fields
                            on your objects or used <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok</a> or something.
                        </small>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Author&gt; authorDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("AUTHOR", Author::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "AUTHOR_SEQUENCE", Author::getId, Author::setId)
            .withStringColumn("NAME", Author::getName, Author::setName);

    DaoBuilder&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredientDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("INGREDIENT", Ingredient::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "INGREDIENT_SEQUENCE", Ingredient::getId, Ingredient::setId)
            .withParentColumn("RECIPE_ID")
            .withStringColumn("NAME", Ingredient::getName, Ingredient::setName)
            .withIntegerColumn("AMOUNT", Ingredient::getAmount, Ingredient::setAmount);

    DaoBuilder&lt;Recipe&gt; recipeDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("RECIPE", Recipe::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "RECIPE_SEQUENCE", Recipe::getId, Recipe::setId)
            .withStringColumn("NAME", Recipe::getName, Recipe::setName)
            .withJoinColumn("AUTHOR_ID", Recipe::getAuthor, Recipe::setAuthor, authorDaoBuilder)
            .withChildren(Recipe::getIngredients, Recipe::setIngredients, ingredientDaoBuilder);
</pre>

                <p>That's pretty painful. Thank God for autocompletion. Once that's done, and assuming you have some way
                    to make
                    a <code>java.sql.Connection</code> object now you can actually make a <code>Dao</code>. Then you can
                    write some code like this.
                </p>

                <pre>
    Connection connection = // somehow this happened

    Dao&lt;Author&gt; authorDao = authorDaoBuilder.buildDao(connection);

    Author juliaChild = new Author();
    juliaChild.setName("Julia Child");

    authorDao.insert(juliaChild);

    Ingredient carrots = new Ingredient();
    carrots.setName("Carrots");
    carrots.setAmount(4L);
    Ingredient onions = new Ingredient();
    onions.setName("Onions");
    onions.setAmount(2L);
    Ingredient beef = new Ingredient();
    beef.setName("Cow");
    beef.setAmount(1L);

    Recipe beefStew = new Recipe():
    beefStew.setName("Beef Stew");
    beefStew.setAuthor(juliaChild);
    beefStew.setIngredients(Arrays.asList(carrots, onions, beef));

    Dao&lt;Recipe&gt; recipeDao = recipeDaoBuilder.buildDao(connection);
    recipeDao.insert(beefStew);
</pre>

                <p>Of course, a <code>Dao</code> can do more than just <code>insert</code>. A <code>Dao</code> can also
                    <code>update</code>, <code>delete</code>, and various forms of <code>select</code>.</p>

                <p>And really, that's all there is to hrorm.</p>

                <h2>Things hrorm Does Not Do</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm is not an all-singing, all-dancing, all-cooking-a-five-course-meal framework. It's a small
                    library for reducing the amount of time you spend writing <code>select FOO, BAR from BAZ</code>
                    and <code>ResultSet rs = statement.execute()</code>. It does not even attempt to go into territory
                    that many other ORM tools do.</p>

                <p>This is only a partial list of all the things hrorm will not do.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Any kind of caching.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to minimize database chatter by lazy-loading or object change tracking. Hrorm assumes
                        that if
                        you make a call to a <code>Dao</code> it's because you want to read or write something in the
                        database.
                    </li>
                    <li>Transaction management. Transactions are for applications, not for hrorm.
                        <a href="#hrorm_and_transactions">(Mostly.)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pollute your code with vexing annotations.</li>
                    <li>Involve itself with any XML or other configuration. Hrorm thinks Java is a better language than
                        XML.
                    </li>
                    <li>Take over your application with background threads or expect some kind of container to exist.
                        Hrorm is a library,
                        if you do not call the methods, hrorm won't do anything.
                    </li>
                    <li>Connection pooling.</li>
                    <li>Reflection.</li>
                    <li>Invent its own query language.</li>
                    <li>Expect you to write SQL yourself.</li>
                    <li>Manage integrity constraints to your schema or object model. (Mostly.)</li>
                    <li>Declare checked exceptions in its client facing interfaces.</li>
                    <li>Have left pad as a dependency.</li>

                <h2>Designing for hrorm</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm only works on a restricted entity model. It expects your Java object model and your SQL schema
                    to
                    work a particular way. If this does not work for you, than neither will hrorm.</p>

                <a name="java_objects"></a>
                <h4>Java Objects</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Every entity class should have a <code>Long</code> identifier field that will be used as a
                        primary key.
                        Hrorm expects that this is a nullable field and that null means unpersisted.
                        Hrorm will populate this field from a sequence (see restrictions on
                        schema below) and will use it when issuing updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hrorm mostly expects to work with Javabean like entities with public getters and setters. I
                        suppose
                        you could have hrorm work with builder objects and then have immutable entities, but then you
                        would
                        have to write some glue code to link it all together.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hrorm expects child objects owned by other objects (in a parent-child style relationship) to
                        hold a reference
                        to the parent's ID, but not a reference to the parent objects themselves. Hrorm is
                        unsophisticated in dealing
                        with circular references.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hrorm expects child relationships to be modeled as <code>List</code> types exclusively. No sets
                        or arrays or
                        other collections.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <a name="sql_schema"></a>
                <h4>SQL Schema</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hrorm expects every table to have a numeric primary key. No string keys or multiple column keys.
                        Hrorm is not really appropriate for a time-series database.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hrorm will populate the primary keys on inserts with values it pulls from a sequence. You can
                        create a separate sequence for each table, or just have one overall sequence if you want. Hrorm
                        does not
                        care, but it wants a sequence for inserts.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    At the moment Hrorm supports a limited number of (Java) datatypes:
                    <code>Long</code>, <code>BigDecimal</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Boolean</code>,
                    and <code>LocalDateTime</code>. Additionally, hrorm supports a mechanism

                    which is intended primarily for enumerated types. Adding supports for new datatypes
                    that are supported by the <code>ResultSet</code> interface should not be particularly
                    difficult if you're a hacker. And if you are using hrorm, you better be.

                <h2>How hrorm Handles Relations</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>One point of a relational database is to preserve the structure of relations between entities.
                    Hrorm supports two kinds of relationships: a parent-child relation where one object contains a list
                    of children, and a sibling relationship, where one object expresses a connection with another
                    entity.</p>

                <a name="parent_child_relations"></a>
                <h4>Parent-Child Relations</h4>

                <p>These relations are defined by using the <code>DaoBuilder.withChildren()</code> method.</p>

                <p>In a parent-child relationship, the child is assumed to be completely dependent on the parent, so
                    that its very existence depends on the existence of the parent.</p>

                <p>Think of the recipe example above. If a recipe is deleted, it makes no sense to preserve the
                    ingredient rows. So, if a call is made on the recipe <code>Dao.delete()</code> method, all
                    the ingredients will be deleted too. Likewise, on an update hrorm will make the necessary inserts,
                    updates, and deletes to the ingredients table to synchronize the object state.</p>

                <p>In fact, you would rarely want to instantiate an ingredients <code>Dao</code> directly.
                    Hrorm will do the work for you.</p>

                <p>One tricky thing about these relationships is the reversal in how ownership is expressed between
                    the database schema and the object model. In the object model, the Hand object has Finger objects.
                    In
                    the database, the FINGER table has foreign key references to the HAND table. The call to the
                    <code>DaoBuilder.withChildren()</code> is somewhat tricky as a result. Most of the time, a
                    <code>DaoBuilder</code> is concerned only with columns on its own table, not so for children
                    objects.</p>

                <a name="sibling_relations"></a>
                <h4>Sibling Relations</h4>

                <p>These relations are defined by using the <code>DaoBuilder.withJoinColumn()</code> method.</p>

                <p>These are relations between two objects where one object refers in a dependent, but not
                    controlling, way.</p>

                <p>In the example above, the relationship between an Author and a Recipe is of this type.
                    A Recipe requires and Author, but neither owns the other.
                </p>

                <p>Hrorm requires that sibling objects be persisted first, and will not handle transitive persistence
                    automatically. Likewise, deleting a Recipe will not cause a cascading delete of an Author
                    record.</p>

                <p>Note well: Hrorm will do nothing to prevent a dependent sibling from being deleted. The application
                    code, or database schema constraints, (or both!) must be in place to prevent orphaned records of
                    that type.</p>

                <h2>Hrorm and Exceptions</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm thinks that checked exceptions are a mistake. In an application with a database dependency,
                    you have three choices:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Have <code>SQLException</code> declared in most methods all over your application.</li>
                    <li>Try to handle <code>SQLException</code> somehow when doing interactions with
                        <code>Connection</code>,
                        <code>Statement</code>, and <code>ResultSet</code> objects, defeating the purpose of
                        exception handling being centralized and removed from normal application flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>Convert <code>SQLException</code> to some other type, descended from
                        <code>RuntimeException</code>.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Hrorm opts for method 3.
                </p>

                <p>Hrorm will throw a <code>HrormException</code> when it has a problem, generally wrapping <code>SQLException</code>.
                    You can pull the underlying exception from it.
                </p>

                <a name="hrorm_and_transactions"></a>
                <h2>Hrorm and Transactions</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>For the most part, hrorm tries to stay out of the transaction handling business.
                    Applications know what changes must be transactions, hrorm does not. However, hrorm's
                    commands to insert, update, and delete records can lead to multiple SQL statements
                    being run, due to the handling of parent-child relationships. This means in the case
                    of an error, the database is at risk of coming to an illegal state.</p>

                <p>If nested transactions were supported natively by every database provider,
                    it would probably be correct to wrap database mutations in an internally nested transaction
                    and commit or rollback on completion. This is not possible for every provider,
                    and mechanisms for how to accomplish this are not identical even for databases that
                    do provide for transaction nesting.</p>

                <p>Hrorm does give a minimal amount of support to attempt to alleviate these issues. Hrorm provides
                    a <a href="/javadocs/latest/org/hrorm/Transactor.html"><code>Transactor</code></a> class
                    with a couple of methods to elminate the boilerplate <code>try ... catch ... finally</code>
                    blocks necessary for doing transactions. In keeping with the hrorm ethos, these methods
                    do not declare any checked exceptions. Keep in mind that a <code>Transactor</code> will
                    <b>automatically close its connection</b> whether or not it completes with a commit or a rollback.
                </p>

                <p>In addition, the <code>Dao</code> interface provides cognate methods for <code>insert</code>,
                    <code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code> named <code>atomicInsert</code>,
                    <code>atomicUpdate</code>, and <code>atomicDelete</code>. These methods provide
                    a no-fuss way to do mutations of parent-child relations. However, these methods
                    must be used with care! In addition to a possibly unexpected early commit if these methods
                    are accidentally used in a larger transaction, remember that, as above, these methods
                    will also <b>close the connection</b> they use when complete.</p>

                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to how to marry the problem of database
                    to object mapping with the problems of transactions and atomicity. For this reason,
                    hrorm mostly just tries to stay out of the way.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>The state of Java logging is a tiny bit unfortunate.</p>

                <p>The <code>java.util.logging</code> package in the standard library is not widely
                used. Unfortunately, rather than a set of pluggable interfaces, they provided a concrete
                implementation.</p>

                <p>Log4j is pretty ubiquitous, but not universal. Additionally, hrorm currently has
                no dependencies. It would be a shame to add one.</p>

                <p>Hrorm therefore uses <code>java.util.logging</code> implementation.
                There are ways to redirect that to log4j and other logging frameworks.</p>

                <p>Hrorm logs to a logger named "org.hrorm" all the SQL it issues at INFO level.</p>

                <h2>Hrorm Visibility</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm is designed to have a small surface area for clients. Most of the time, clients should only
                    need to interact with three hrorm types: <code>DaoBuilder</code>, <code>Dao</code>, and
                    <code>HrormException</code>. Clients might also be expected to create a few instances of
                    <code>Converter</code> objects and perhaps to use a <code>Transactor</code>. After that,
                    there is nothing in Hrorm that is designed to be used in client code.</p>

                <p>In spite of this, almost all the classes in hrorm are public and contain public constructors
                    and methods. If you feel like instantiating a <code>StringColumn</code> object, hrorm feels
                    no need to try to stop you.</p>

                <p>Most of the time, hrorm will point out in the Javadocs where classes are not
                    intended for clients to use directly.</p>

                <h2>Falling Off a Cliff</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Sometimes when using an ORM tool, development goes great right until you fall off a cliff. The
                    ORM tool takes care of many details about state tracking, caching, SQL generation, transactions,
                    etc, and everything is just fine. But then you need to do something that your ORM tool does not support.
                    Perhaps not a large thing, perhaps just optimize one particular query or other. And you find, you
                    cannot do it. Yes, you can optimize the query, but there's no way to inject that logic into
                    the framework. And if you just have that query outside the framework, then you cannot integrate it
                    with all the caching, state-tracking, transaction managing stuff your framework provides you.
                </p>

                <p>You just fell off the cliff.</p>

                <p>It's like the old joke about the traveller asking the farmer how to get to some village in
                the area and receiving the reply: "You can't get there from here."</p>

                <p>Hrorm is a minimal library, not a maximal framework. It should be possible to integrate custom features you
                need in your application easily. To make <code>Dao</code> objects, all you need is a vanilla
                <code>java.sql.Connection</code>. You can freely mix calls to hrorm objects with custom logic
                for managing transactions or querying the database or anything else as you see fit.</p>

                <p>Hrorm will not fall off a cliff. It starts at the bottom, and stays there.</p>
