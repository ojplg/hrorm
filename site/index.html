                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Java.
                    Hrorm is a concise, declarative, type-checked library for the creation of Data Access Objects (DAOs).
                    Hrorm requires no external configuration or dependencies.</p>

                <p>Hrorm exists to reduce the amount of boilerplate code (in both Java and SQL) you have to write to
                    manage persistence of Java objects to a relational (SQL) data store without inflicting you
                    with XMLosis or annotationitis.</p>

                <p>The hrorm <a href="/javadocs/latest/org/hrorm/DaoBuilder.html"><code>DaoBuilder</code></a>
                    class provides methods to describe the relationship between an object and its backing table. Once your
                    <code>DaoBuilder</code> objects are defined and you have a <code>java.sql.Connection</code>, you can
                    create <a href="/javadocs/latest/org/hrorm/Dao.html"><code>Dao</code></a> objects
                    for performing CRUD operations.</p>

                <p>Hrorm is opinionated about how Java object models and SQL schemas should be designed. It will
                    not play well with all schemas and objects. If you want freedom, look elsewhere.</p>

                <h2>Quick Start</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Suppose you are working on a program for managing recipes that has a domain model that looks like
                    this.</p>

                <pre>
    class Author {
        Long id;
        String name;
    }

    class Recipe {
        Long id;
        String name;
        Author author;
        List&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredients;
    }

    class Ingredient {
        Long id;
        String name;
        long amount;
    }
</pre>

                <p>You might ask yourself: how will I persist such a rich, complex model? And you might think ...
                    I know, I'll put everything into a <code>List</code> and call <code>serialize()</code>
                    and write that to a file on disk.
                    How many recipes and simultaneous users are we expecting to support anyway?
                </p>

                <p>But instead, you come up with the following relational schema.</p>

                <img src="recipe_schema.png" height="384" width="576" alt="sql schema for recipes showing author recipe and ingredients">

                <p>Because you are the absolute Empress of Overkill.</p>

                <p>Some might think to use <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> or
                    <a href="http://www.mybatis.org/mybatis-3/">Mybatis</a> or something, but no, you
                    are a real glutton for punishment, so you decide to use hrorm and write some code like this,
                    which defines in terms of hrorm <code>DaoBuilder</code> objects the relationship
                    between the database schema and the Java object model.</p>

                <div class="disclaimer" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p>
                        <small>Disclaimer: Yeah, I assume that your schema has some sequences that are not in the
                            picture above. Also, you should have created getters and setters for all of the fields
                            on your objects or used <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok</a> or something.
                        </small>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Author&gt; authorDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("AUTHOR", Author::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "AUTHOR_SEQUENCE", Author::getId, Author::setId)
            .withStringColumn("NAME", Author::getName, Author::setName);

    DaoBuilder&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredientDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("INGREDIENT", Ingredient::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "INGREDIENT_SEQUENCE", Ingredient::getId, Ingredient::setId)
            .withParentColumn("RECIPE_ID")
            .withStringColumn("NAME", Ingredient::getName, Ingredient::setName)
            .withIntegerColumn("AMOUNT", Ingredient::getAmount, Ingredient::setAmount);

    DaoBuilder&lt;Recipe&gt; recipeDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("RECIPE", Recipe::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "RECIPE_SEQUENCE", Recipe::getId, Recipe::setId)
            .withStringColumn("NAME", Recipe::getName, Recipe::setName)
            .withJoinColumn("AUTHOR_ID", Recipe::getAuthor, Recipe::setAuthor, authorDaoBuilder)
            .withChildren(Recipe::getIngredients, Recipe::setIngredients, ingredientDaoBuilder);
</pre>

                <p>That's pretty painful. Thank God for autocompletion. Once that's done, and assuming you have some way
                    to make
                    a <code>java.sql.Connection</code> object now you can actually make a <code>Dao</code>. Then you can
                    write some code like this.
                </p>

                <pre>
    Connection connection = // somehow this happened

    // Let's make a new author object!
    Author juliaChild = new Author();
    juliaChild.setName("Julia Child");

    // hrorm makes it easy to persist
    Dao&lt;Author&gt; authorDao = authorDaoBuilder.buildDao(connection);
    authorDao.insert(juliaChild);

    // now for Julia's famous Beef bourguignon
    Recipe beefStew = new Recipe():
    beefStew.setName("Beef Stew");
    beefStew.setAuthor(juliaChild);

    // needs some ingredients
    Ingredient carrots = new Ingredient();
    carrots.setName("Carrots");
    carrots.setAmount(4L);
    Ingredient onions = new Ingredient();
    onions.setName("Onions");
    onions.setAmount(2L);
    Ingredient beef = new Ingredient();
    beef.setName("Cow");
    beef.setAmount(1L);
    Ingredient wine = new Ingredient();
    wine.setName("Red Wine");
    beef.setAmount(10L);

    beefStew.setIngredients(Arrays.asList(carrots, onions, beef, wine));

    // with hrorm, we just persist the recipe, it will take care of
    // the ingredients for us
    Dao&lt;Recipe&gt; recipeDao = recipeDaoBuilder.buildDao(connection);
    recipeDao.insert(beefStew);

    // that was perfectly cromulent
</pre>

                <p>Of course, a <code>Dao</code> can do more than just <code>insert</code>. A <code>Dao</code> can also
                    <code>update</code>, <code>delete</code>, and various forms of <code>select</code>.</p>

                <p>And really, that's all there is to hrorm.</p>

                <h2>Designing with hrorm</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm is opinionated about how entities should be built. It will not work with any object model
                or schema. However, many of the opinions that hrorm has are good practices to follow, regardless
                of how database records are translated to and from objects.</p>

                <p>Here's the skinny about hrorm entities. (Entities means the things being modeled,
                either in their Java class representation, or in their database table representation.)</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Entities should have a numeric, primary key. (With <a href="/documentation/latest#keyless_entities">limited exceptions</a>.)</li>
                    <li>That primary key should be created from values issued from a database sequence.</li>
                    <li>Entities can contain lists of other entities. In this case, the object containing the
                        other entities is referred to as a parent, and the entities in its list, its children.
                        Parent-child relationships in hrorm are <b>owning</b> relationships. The persistence
                        of children is dependent upon the persistence of parents.</li>
                    <li>Entities can contain references to other entities without ownership, but in this case,
                        the an object has a reference to a single other object.
                        Hrorm refers to these cases as sibling relationships.</li>
                    <li>References between entities are accomplished through their primary keys in the database,
                        but through object references in Java.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Entity models that do not follow the practices above will be difficult or impossible to
                support using hrorm.</p>

                <a id="things_hrorm_does_not_do"></a>
                <h2>Things hrorm Does Not Do</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm is not an all-singing, all-dancing, all-cooking-a-five-course-meal framework. It's a small
                    library for reducing the amount of time you spend writing <code>select FOO, BAR from BAZ</code>
                    and <code>ResultSet rs = statement.execute()</code>. It does not even attempt to go into territory
                    that many other ORM tools do.</p>

                <p>This is only a partial list of all the things hrorm will not do.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Any kind of caching.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to minimize database chatter by lazy-loading or object change tracking. Hrorm assumes
                        that if you make a call to a <code>Dao</code> it's because you want to read or write something in the
                        database. (But <a href="/documentation/latest#folding">see here</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>Transaction management. Transactions are for applications, not for hrorm.
                        <a href="/documentation/latest#transactions">(Mostly.)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pollute your code with vexing annotations.</li>
                    <li>Involve itself with any XML or other configuration. Or anything else that cannot support
                        the type information your entities deserve. Hrorm thinks Java is a better language than
                        XML. <a href="/documentation/latest#validation">(Yep.)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Take over your application with background threads or expect some kind of container to exist.
                        Hrorm is a library,
                        if you do not call the methods, hrorm won't do anything.
                    </li>
                    <li>Connection pooling.</li>
                    <li>Reflection.</li>
                    <li>Invent its own query language.</li>
                    <li>Expect you to write <a href="/documentation/latest#sql">SQL</a> yourself.</li>
                    <li>Manage integrity constraints to your schema or object model.
                        <a href="/documentation/latest#constraints">(Mostly.)</a></li>
                    <li>Declare <a href="/documentation/latest#exceptions">checked exceptions</a> in its client facing interfaces.</li>

                <h2>Falling Off a Cliff</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Sometimes when using an ORM tool, development goes great right until you fall off a cliff. The
                    ORM tool takes care of many details about state tracking, caching, SQL generation, transactions,
                    etc, and everything is just fine. But then you need to do something that your ORM tool does not support.
                    Perhaps not a large thing, perhaps just optimize one particular query or other. And you find, you
                    cannot do it. Yes, you can optimize the query, but there's no way to inject that logic into
                    the framework. And if you just have that query outside the framework, then you cannot integrate it
                    with all the caching, state-tracking, transaction managing stuff your framework provides you.
                </p>

                <p>You just fell off the cliff.</p>

                <p>It's like the old joke about the traveler asking the farmer how to get to some village in
                the area and receiving the reply: "You can't get there from here."</p>

                <p>Hrorm is a minimal library, not a maximal framework. It should be possible to integrate custom features you
                need in your application easily. To make <code>Dao</code> objects, all you need is a vanilla
                <code>java.sql.Connection</code>. You can freely mix calls to hrorm objects with custom logic
                for managing transactions or querying the database or anything else as you see fit.</p>

                <p>Hrorm will not fall off a cliff. It starts at the bottom, and stays there.</p>
