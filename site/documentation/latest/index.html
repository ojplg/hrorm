            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Interactions with hrorm have two major points: building <code>Dao</code> objects and then using them.</p>

            <p><code>Dao</code> building is accomplished with the aptly named <code>DaoBuilder</code> class.
                <code>DaoBuilder</code> objects are part of the one-time (static, singleton) initiation of
                your application. There is little point in having more than one builder of any entity type.
                Of course, some care must be taken: by their nature, <code>DaoBuilder</code> objects are
                mutable, so if you directly expose them to the rest of your application during start up,
                it's possible that you can do something stupid.
            </p>

            <p><code>Dao</code> objects themselves are what perform the actual tasks of persisting and
                instantiating entity objects. To make a <code>Dao</code> requires a <code>Connection</code>
                object. Since a <code>Dao</code> keeps a stateful <code>Connection</code> to the underlying
                data store, it is dangerous to share instances across threads. Generally, the idea is to
                instantiate a <code>Dao</code> when you need it, and then allow it to be garbage collected.
                It is up the application itself to deal with reaping the <code>Connection</code>, with some exceptions
                noted below.</p>

            <p>Also take a look at the <a href="/#quick_start">Quick Start</a> and <a
                    href="/javadocs/latest">Javadocs</a>.</p>

            <a name="concepts"></a>
            <h2>Concepts</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Before diving into the nuts-and-bolts of how to use hrorm, it is helpful to understand the
            ideas it implements.</p>

            <div class="card fluid">

                <a name="designing_entities"></a>
                <h2>Designing Entities</h2>

                <hr>

                <p>Using hrorm means accepting some restrictions on how your entities (both the Java classes
                and the SQL schema) are designed. Some of these restrictions are good practices regardless of
                how database and object models are built.</p>

                <a name="java_objects"></a>
                <h4>Java Objects</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Every entity class should have a <code>Long</code> identifier field that will be used as a
                        primary key.
                        Hrorm expects that this is a nullable field and that null means unpersisted.
                        Hrorm will populate this field from a sequence (see restrictions on
                        schema below), unless you use an <a href="#immutable_models" class="sublink-1">immutable model</a>.
                        The primary key will be used it when hrorm performs updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hrorm expects to work with Javabean like entities with public getters and setters or
                        with entities with public getters for fields and related builder objects with setters
                        for the individual fields. (See documentation for <a
                                href="/documentation/latest#immutable_models">Immutable Models</a>.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Hrorm expects child relationships to be modeled as <code>List</code> types exclusively. No sets
                        or arrays or other collections.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <a name="sql_schema"></a>
                <h4>SQL Schema</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hrorm expects every table to have a numeric primary key. No string keys or multiple column keys.
                        Hrorm is not really appropriate for a time-series database.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hrorm will populate the primary keys on inserts with values it pulls from a sequence. You can
                        create a separate sequence for each table, or just have one overall sequence if you want. Hrorm
                        does not care, but it wants a sequence for inserts.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    At the moment Hrorm supports a limited number of (Java) datatypes:
                    <code>Long</code>, <code>BigDecimal</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Boolean</code>,
                    and <code>LocalDateTime</code>. Additionally, hrorm supports a mechanism
                    for persisting values that can be converted to and from <code>String</code>,
                    which is intended primarily for enumerated types. Adding supports for new datatypes
                    that are supported by the <code>ResultSet</code> interface should not be particularly
                    difficult if you're a hacker.

                <a name="relationships"></a>
                <h3>Relationships</h3>

                <hr>

                <p>One point of using a relational database as opposed to a document store or other mechanism
                    is to preserve the structure of relations between entities.
                    Hrorm supports two kinds of relationships: a parent-child relation where one object contains a list
                    of children, and a sibling relationship, where one object expresses a connection with another
                    entity.</p>

                <a name="parent_child_relations_concept"></a>
                <h4>Parent-Child Relations</h4>

                <p>These relations are defined by using the <code>DaoBuilder.withParent()</code> and
                    <code>DaoBuilder.withChildren()</code> methods.</p>

                <p>In a parent-child relationship, the child is assumed to be completely dependent on the parent, so
                    that its very existence depends on the existence of the parent.</p>

                <p>Take a look at the <a href="/#quick_start">recipe example</a>.
                    If a recipe is deleted, it makes no sense to preserve the
                    ingredient rows. So, if a call is made on the recipe <code>Dao.delete()</code> method, all
                    the ingredients will be deleted too. Likewise, on an update hrorm will make the necessary inserts,
                    updates, and deletes to the ingredients table to synchronize the object state.</p>

                <p>In fact, you would rarely want to instantiate an ingredients <code>Dao</code> directly.
                    Hrorm will do the work for you.</p>

                <p>One tricky thing about these relationships is the reversal in how ownership is expressed between
                    the database schema and the object model. In the object model, the Hand object has Finger objects.
                    In the database, the FINGER table has foreign key references to the HAND table. With hrorm, the
                    <code>DaoBuilder</code> object of both the parent and child need to understand
                    the relationship, not just one or the other.</p>

                <a name="sibling_relations_concept"></a>
                <h4>Sibling Relations</h4>

                <p>These relations are defined by using the <code>DaoBuilder.withJoinColumn()</code> method.</p>

                <p>These are relations between two objects where one object refers in a dependent, but not
                    controlling, way.</p>

                <p>In the  <a href="/#quick_start">recipe example</a>, the relationship between an Author and a Recipe is of this type.
                    A Recipe requires an Author, but neither owns the other.
                </p>

                <p>Hrorm requires that sibling objects be persisted first, and will not handle transitive persistence
                    automatically. Likewise, deleting a Recipe will not cause a cascading delete of an Author
                    record.</p>

                <p>Note well: Hrorm will do nothing to prevent a dependent sibling from being deleted. The application
                    code, or database schema constraints, (or both!) must be in place to prevent orphaned records of
                    that type.</p>

            </div>


            <div class="card fluid">

                <a name="transactions"></a>
                <h3>Transactions</h3>

                <hr>

                <p>For the most part, hrorm tries to stay out of the transaction handling business.
                    Applications know what changes must be transactions, hrorm does not. However, hrorm's
                    commands to insert, update, and delete records can lead to multiple SQL statements
                    being run, due to the handling of parent-child relationships. This means in the case
                    of an error, the database is at risk of coming to an illegal state.</p>

                <p>If nested transactions were supported natively by every database provider,
                    it would probably be correct to wrap database mutations in an internally nested transaction
                    and commit or rollback on completion. This is not possible for every provider,
                    and mechanisms for how to accomplish this are not identical even for databases that
                    do provide for transaction nesting.</p>

                <p>Hrorm does give a minimal amount of support to attempt to alleviate these issues. Hrorm provides
                    a <a href="/javadocs/latest/org/hrorm/Transactor.html"><code>Transactor</code></a> class
                    with a couple of methods to elminate the boilerplate <code>try ... catch ... finally</code>
                    blocks necessary for doing transactions. In keeping with the hrorm ethos, these methods
                    do not declare any checked exceptions. Keep in mind that a <code>Transactor</code> will
                    <b>automatically close its connection</b> whether or not it completes with a commit or a rollback.
                </p>

                <p>In addition, the <code>Dao</code> interface provides cognate methods for <code>insert</code>,
                    <code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code> named <code>atomicInsert</code>,
                    <code>atomicUpdate</code>, and <code>atomicDelete</code>. These methods provide
                    a no-fuss way to do mutations of parent-child relations. However, these methods
                    must be used with care! In addition to a possibly unexpected early commit if these methods
                    are accidentally used in a larger transaction, remember that, as above, these methods
                    will also <b>close the connection</b> they use when complete.</p>

                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to how to marry the problem of database
                    to object mapping with the problems of transactions and atomicity. For this reason,
                    hrorm mostly just tries to stay out of the way.</p>

            </div>


            <a name="daobuilders"></a>
            <h2>Dao Builders</h2>

            <p>Hrorm provides two kinds of builders: one for Javabean style entities (<code>DaoBuilder</code>) and
                one for immutable object models with separate builder objects (<code>IndirectDaoBuilder</code>).
                Both support very similar methods, and though most of the examples below show a plain
                <code>DaoBuilder</code> building for an immutable model is almost identical.</p>

            <a name="one_table"></a>
            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>One Table</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The easiest case for any ORM tool is persisting a single object backed by a single table.
                    Let's work on persisting a model for a person that includes the following elements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name (a string or text)</li>
                    <li>Weight in kilograms (an integer)</li>
                    <li>Height in meters (a decimal)</li>
                    <li>Birthday (a date)</li>
                    <li>High school graduate? (a boolean)</li>
                    <li>Hair color (an enumerated type)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To model the person entity, we write a Java Person object.</p>

                <pre>
    class Person {
        Long id;
        String name;
        long weight;
        BigDecimal height;
        LocalDateTime birthday;
        boolean isHighSchoolGraduate;
        HairColor hairColor;
    }</pre>

                <p>A few small points.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Use your imagination to fill in getters, setters, equals, hashCode, etc.</li>
                    <li>We have one extra field that we did not have in our logical model: an id field that is to be
                        used
                        for persistence.
                    </li>
                    <li>Assume that there is an enumerated type for hair color: <code>HairColor.Black</code>, <code>HairColor.Brown</code>,
                        etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the database we will create two structures for persisting this class: a table to store the data
                    and a sequence to issue the IDs.</p>

                <pre>
    CREATE SEQUENCE PERSON_SEQUENCE;

    CREATE TABLE PERSON_TABLE (
        ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        NAME TEXT,
        WEIGHT INTEGER,
        HEIGHT DECIMAL,
        BIRTHDAY TIMESTAMP,
        IS_HIGH_SCHOOL_GRADUATE TEXT,
        HAIR_COLOR TEXT
    );</pre>

                <p>Note the somewhat different types than in the Java code. In particular, the boolean and
                    enumeration values have become text fields. SQL has a more limited palate for the expression
                    of types than Java.</p>

                <p>To translate between the database reprentation and the Java representation, we plan to use
                    a <code>Dao</code> object. We could build that directly, but hrorm provides a DaoBuilder
                    class that makes things much easier. In hrorm, both <code>Dao</code> objects and their builders
                    are parameterized on the type of thing they persist. We start off by simply calling the
                    <code>DaoBuilder</code> constructor.</p>

                <pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Person&gt; daoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("PERSON_TABLE", Person::new);</pre>

                <p>The constructor takes two arguments: the name of the table and a no-argument method for
                    creating a new instance of the parameterized type.</p>

                <p>Next, we need to define the primary key for this entity.</p>

                <pre>
    daoBuilder.withPrimaryKey("ID","PERSON_SEQUENCE", Person::getId, Person::setId);</pre>

                <p>The primary key is defined with four elements:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The name of the primary key column in the table ("ID")</li>
                    <li>The name of the sequence that populates the primary keys ("PERSON_SEQUENCE")</li>
                    <li>A function that retrieves the primary key (of type <code>Long</code>) from the
                        <code>Person</code> object.
                    </li>
                    <li>A function that can set the primary key onto the object.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>With that covered, we can being to teach the <code>DaoBuilder</code> about the individual data
                    elements. First, we will teach it about the name field.</p>

                <pre>
    daoBuilder.withStringColumn("NAME", Person::getName, Person::setName);</pre>

                <p>This explains that that table has a column named "NAME" and that the value in the table can
                    be populated from calling <code>getName()</code> on a <code>Person</code>, and that value
                    can be set by calling <code>setName()</code>. There are other methods on the <code>DaoBuilder</code>
                    for other Java types.</p>

                <p>For the integer weight value (which should actually be a <code>Long</code> or <code>long</code>,
                    not an <code>int</code> or <code>short</code>).</p>

                <pre>
    daoBuilder.withIntegerColumn("WEIGHT", Person::getWeight, Person::setWeight);</pre>

                <p>For fractional, decimal, or floating point values, hrorm supports the
                    <code>java.math.BigDecimal</code> type.</p>

                <pre>
    daoBuilder.withBigDecimalColumn("HEIGHT", Person::getHeight, Person::setHeight);</pre>

                <p>For dates and times, hrorm supports the <code>java.time.LocalDateTime</code> type.</p>

                <pre>
    daoBuilder.withLocalDateTimeColumn("BIRTHDAY", Person::getBirthday, Person::setBirthday);</pre>

                <p>And similarly for boolean values. Note that the table should declare a text or string value.
                    ANSI SQL does not support a boolean column type. Hrorm will convert between Java's boolean
                    enumeration of true/false with the strings "T" and "F" in the database.
                </p>

                <pre>
    daoBuilder.withBooleanColumn("IS_HIGH_SCHOOL_GRADUATE", Person::isHighSchoolGraduate, Person::setHighSchoolGraduate);</pre>

                <p>For the enumerated <code>HairColor</code> type, hrorm needs a bit more help, via an implementation
                    of its <code>Converter</code> interface. We need a simple class that looks like this:</p>

                <pre>
    class HairColorConverter implements Converter&lt;HairColor, String&gt; {
        @Override
        public String from(HairColor item) {
            return item.getColorName();
        }

        @Override
        public HairColor to(String s) {
            return HairColor.forColorName(s);
        }
    }</pre>

                <p>Once the <code>Converter</code> exists, we can teach the <code>DaoBuilder</code> about it
                    and the hair color field.</p>

                <pre>
    daoBuilder.withConvertingStringColumn("HAIR_COLOR", Person::getHairColor, Person::setHairColor, new HairColorConverter());</pre>

                <p>Notice that in addition to the usual fields for column name, getter, and setter, we additionally
                    must specify the conversion mechanism.</p>

                <p>That completes the <code>DaoBuilder</code>. Now we can actually build a
                    <code>Dao&lt;Person&gt;</code>
                    object, assuming we have a <code>java.sql.Connection</code>.</p>

                <p>But before that, we should note that the <code>DaoBuilder</code> supports a fluent interface,
                    so we could write all of the above as:</p>

                <pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Person&gt; daoBuilder = new DaoBuilder<>("PERSON_TABLE", Person::new)
                .withPrimaryKey("ID","PERSON_SEQUENCE", Person::getId, Person::setId)
                .withStringColumn("NAME", Person::getName, Person::setName)
                .withIntegerColumn("WEIGHT", Person::getWeight, Person::setWeight)
                .withBigDecimalColumn("HEIGHT", Person::getHeight, Person::setHeight)
                .withLocalDateTimeColumn("BIRTHDAY", Person::getBirthday, Person::setBirthday)
                .withBooleanColumn("IS_HIGH_SCHOOL_GRADUATE", Person::isHighSchoolGraduate, Person::setHighSchoolGraduate)
                .withConvertingStringColumn("HAIR_COLOR", Person::getHairColor, Person::setHairColor, new HairColorConverter());</pre>

                <p>In just 8 lines of code, we have taught hrorm everything it needs to know to CRUD <code>Person</code>
                    objects.</p>

            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Parent-Child Relations</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>When one entity contains a collection of other entities, hrorm calls that a parent child
                    relation.</p>

                <p>Here is a simple model for tracking inventories of stocks of things through time. At each instant
                    that we measure, we want to know what quantity of each product we have.</p>

                <pre>
    public class Inventory {
        Long id;
        LocalDateTime date;
        List&lt;Stock&gt; stocks;
    }

    public class Stock {
        Long id;
        String productName;
        BigDecimal amount;
    }</pre>

                <p>The <code>Inventory</code> class represents a snapshot in time of what was available in inventory,
                    modeled as a <code>List</code> of <code>Stock</code> items, each of which contains a product name
                    and a decimal quantity of how much of that thing is available. Notice that the <code>Stock</code>
                    model
                    includes a reference to the inventory ID, but not the inventory object itself.</p>

                <p>To model this in the database, we make each item in the <code>STOCK</code> table point back to
                    an <code>INVENTORY</code> record, as follows.</p>

                <pre>
    CREATE TABLE INVENTORY (
        ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        DATE TIMESTAMP
    );

    CREATE TABLE STOCK (
        ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        INVENTORY_ID INTEGER,
        PRODUCT_NAME TEXT,
        AMOUNT DECIMAL
    );

    CREATE SEQUENCE INVENTORY_SEQUENCE;
    CREATE SEQUENCE STOCK_SEQUENCE;</pre>

                <p>To model this in hrorm, we need to teach it about the parent-child relationship between the two
                    entities
                    using the <code>DaoBuilder.withParentColumn()</code> and <code>DaoBuilder.withChildren()</code>
                    methods.
                    First we make a Dao for the <code>Stock</code> entity.</p>

                <pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Stock&gt; stockDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("STOCK", Stock::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID","STOCK_SEQUENCE", Stock::getId, Stock::setId)
            .withParentColumn("INVENTORY_ID")
            .withStringColumn("PRODUCT_NAME", Stock::getProductName, Stock::setProductName)
            .withBigDecimalColumn("AMOUNT", Stock::getAmount, Stock::setAmount);</pre>

                <p>The column <code>INVENTORY_ID</code> is marked not as an integer column,
                    but with the special <code>withParentColumn</code> method.
                    An entity can have only one parent. In the <code>Inventory</code>
                    <code>DaoBuilder</code> we use the <code>withChildren</code> method
                    to complete the relationship definition..</p>

                <pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Inventory&gt; inventoryDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("INVENTORY", Inventory::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "INVENTORY_SEQUENCE", Inventory::getId, Inventory::setId)
            .withLocalDateTimeColumn("DATE", Inventory::getDate, Inventory::setDate)
            .withChildren(Inventory::getStocks, Inventory::setStocks, stockDaoBuilder);</pre>

                <p>When we create a <code>Dao</code> in this fashion we create a category of entity, the child,
                    that is wholly dependent upon another, the parent. Whenever we insert, update, delete, or
                    select the parent entity, the changes we make flow through the children and transitively
                    to their children.</p>

                <p>Be careful, if you do not want the children to be deleted, this is not the relationship
                    you want to build. In particular, remember that issuing an <code>update</code>
                    will result not just in a SQL <code>UPDATE</code> in the database, but possibly
                    a whole series of <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>
                    queries being run.</p>

                <p>Hrorm always understands child objects to be members of type <code>List</code>.
                    No other collection type is supported.</p>

                <h5>Back-References</h5>

                <p>If your object model for includes a back-reference from the child to the parent,
                    Hrorm will populate it for you. If in the model above, the <code>Stock</code>
                    class had a reference to its parent <code>Inventory</code> we could use an
                    overloaded <code>withParentColumn()</code> method call on its <code>DaoBuilder</code>
                    as follows:</p>

                <pre>
    .withParentColumn("INVENTORY_ID", Stock::getInventory, Stock::setInventory)</pre>

                <p>That will cause the reference to the parent object to be automatically
                    set when using any of the <code>Dao</code> <code>select</code> methods.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Sibling Relations</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>When one entity object contains a reference to another entity object, hrorm calls that a
                    sibling or join relationship.</p>

                <p>Consider a model of cities and states, where each city contains a reference to a state.</p>

                <pre>
    class State {
        Long id;
        String name;
    }

    class City {
        Long id;
        String name;
        State state;
    }</pre>

                <p>This could be backed by this schema.</p>

                <pre>
    CREATE TABLE STATE (
        ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        NAME TEXT,
    );

    CREATE TABLE CITY (
        ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        NAME TEXT,
        STATE_ID INTEGER
    );

    CREATE SEQUENCE STATE_SEQUENCE;
    CREATE SEQUENCE CITY_SEQUENCE;</pre>

                <p>Creating the <code>State</code> <code>DaoBuilder</code> is trivial.</p>

                <pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;State&gt; stateDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("STATE", State::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "STATE_SEQUENCE", State::getId, State::setId)
            .withStringColumn("NAME", State::getName, State::setName);</pre>

                <p>There is one new trick to creating the <code>City</code> <code>DaoBuilder</code>: using the
                    <code>DaoBuilder.joinColumn()</code> method which will refer to the <code>stateDaoBuilder</code>
                    we just defined.</p>

                <pre>
     DaoBuilder&lt;City&gt; cityDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("CITY", City::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("ID", "CITY_SEQUENCE", City::getId, City::setId)
            .withStringColumn("NAME", City::getName, City::setName)
            .withJoinColumn("STATE_ID", City::getState, City::setState, stateDaoBuilder);</pre>

                <p>The <code>withJoinColumn</code> method accepts an extra parameter: a <code>DaoDescriptor</code>.
                    Both <code>DaoBuilder</code> and the <code>Dao</code> class implement this interface. Generally,
                    it's much more convenient to create all the builder objects together.</p>

                <p><b>Sibling or join relationships in hrorm are one-way.</b> One object declares that it has a
                    reference
                    to another. Trying to make a circular relationship will lead to errors.</p>

                <p>When hrorm instantiates objects like <code>City</code> from the database, it automatically
                    instantiates the appropriate sibling <code>State</code> objects and sets the field in the
                    <code>City</code> object.</p>

                <p>Of course, you could just treat these as two one-table <code>Dao</code> objects, and then
                    right some code to glue things together. In addition to being inconvenient, this will likely
                    have poorer performance, since hrorm will issue a SQL left join to load the <code>City</code>
                    and <code>State</code> objects with one query.</p>

                <p>Objects can have several join columns, and those objects can have their own join columns.
                    Hrorm will attempt to transitively load the entire object graph when a <code>select()</code> method
                    is called
                    on the <code>Dao</code>. There is a limit to how many joins hrorm can perform. Additionally, there
                    is a limit to how many joins a database engine will allow. Consider this when designing
                    <code>Dao</code>
                    objects.
                    Also remember, sibling relationships are for reading and populating objects,
                    not for making saves or updates. If a sibling object is mutated, it must be saved itself.</p>

                <a name="immutable_models"></a>
                <h3>Immutable Models</h3>

                <hr>

                <p>If you prefer that your Java entity model be made up of immutable classes, hrorm can support
                    that.</p>

                <p>Hrorm works well with immutable objects that have distinct builder classes for managing their
                    setters.
                    To allow this, hrorm provides an <a href="/javadocs/latest/org/hrorm/IndirectDaoBuilder.html"><code>IndirectDaoBuilder</code></a>
                    class. The indirect moniker is intended to suggest that the entities will not be directly
                    constructed,
                    but that will be handled by the builder objects.</p>

                <p>The following example uses lombok style builders, but you can roll your own if that's what you
                    prefer.</p>

                <pre>
    @lombok.Builder
    @lombok.Data
    public class ImmutableThing {
        private final Long id;
        private final String word;
        private final BigDecimal amount;
    }

    IndirectDaoBuilder&lt;ImmutableThing, ImmutableThing.ImmutableThingBuilder&gt; immutableThingDaoBuilder =
            new IndirectDaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("immutable_thing", ImmutableThing::builder, ImmutableThing.ImmutableThingBuilder::build)
            .withPrimaryKey("id", "immutable_thing_seq", ImmutableThing::getId, ImmutableThing.ImmutableThingBuilder::id)
            .withBigDecimalColumn("amount", ImmutableThing::getAmount, ImmutableThing.ImmutableThingBuilder::amount)
            .withStringColumn("word", ImmutableThing::getWord, ImmutableThing.ImmutableThingBuilder::word);

    Connection connection = // comes from somewhere

    // this retured object implements the identical interface as any other hrorm Dao
    Dao&lt;ImmutableThing&gt; immutableThingDao = immutableThingDaoBuilder.buildDao(connection);</pre>

                <p>It works very similarly to the regular <code>DaoBuilder</code>, but some extra details
                    are required. There are now two type parameters: one for the entity itself and
                    one for its builder object. On construction, instead of simply showing how to create
                    a new entity instance, two parameters show how to make a new builder instance and
                    how to make a new entity instance from the builder. Finally, all the setters are
                    specified on the builder class, not the entity instance.</p>

                <p>With a regular <code>Dao</code> the object's primary key will be set on
                    the object during the <code>insert()</code>. This is not true for <code>Dao</code>
                    objects created from an <code>IndirectDaoBuilder</code>. The <code>insert</code>
                    method will still return the newly issued ID.</p>

                <p>Indirect Dao objects support all the mechanisms for child and sibling records
                    that regular Dao objects do. Due to the lack of population of IDs, some care
                    must be taken. You cannot simply insert a sibling object and then
                    immediately place it into a new entity instance, since it will not yet
                    have its ID set.</p>

            </div>

                <a name="keyless_entities"></a>
                <h3>Keyless Entities</h3>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm is built to support tables that have sequence valued primary keys. This is generally
                a good way to design a schema, but it's not always optimal. For instance, if you are storing
                an event stream in a database, assigning keys might just be a waste of time and space.</p>

                <p>Hrorm does have some mechanisms for supporting entities that do not have primary
                keys. But, you cannot create a full-featured <code>Dao</code> for an entity without
                a primary key. In these cases, you can create a <code>KeylessDao</code> which
                has fewer methods.</p>

                <p>Another drawback to the entities that are keyless is that they cannot be used as
                child or sibling entities. Hrorm manages all relationships via keys.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="constraints"></a>
            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm provides little support for placing constraints on your object models or
                    schema. The correct place for that is within your object model or schema or, best
                    of all, both.</p>

                <p>The <code>DaoBuilder</code> does allow you to mark particular columns as not null,
                    by calling the <code>notNull</code> method. It will apply that constraint to the
                    last column added to the growing definition.</p>

                <p>Where a not null condition is defined in hrorm, it will prevent the creation
                    of null entries in the particular field in question, either through inserts
                    or updates. However, hrorm will ignore the constraint when attempting load
                    records from the database, on the theory that loading questionable data is
                    better than not loading it.</p>

                <p>Since a properly designed object model and database schema can easily replicate
                    this functionality and provide other much more significant invariant enforcement,
                    it must be admitted that this facility is of little practical use.</p>

                <p>One case where this can be helpful is during periods of data migration. If some
                    element is moving from optional to required, Hrorm can at least help creating new
                    records without the newly required element, until such time as more robust
                    enforcement of constraints can be implemented by the application and database.</p>

                    help in sure the database schema is in sync with the code.</p>

                <p>The validation provided is not a substitute for testing that code works as intended. It simply
                    checks that the names of the tables, columns, and sequences provided in the <code>Dao</code>
                    descriptions exist as stated. Columns are checked to make sure they are
                    of a correct type. As such, it can quickly find typos or other simple errors and
                    report them. This can be particularly useful in times of database refactoring.</p>

                <p>To check that a particular <code>Dao</code> is correct, simply pass it, or its builder,
                    to the <code>Validator::validate</code> method with a live <code>Connection</code>.
                    If the validation fails, an exception will be raised whose message describes the problems
                    found.</p>

                <pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Entity&gt; daoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("TABLE", Entity::new)
            .withPrimaryKey("id", "SEQUENCE", Entity::getId, Entity::setId)
            .withStringColumn("STRING_COL", Entity::getStringThing, Entity::setStringThing)
            .withIntegerColumn("INT_COL", Entity::getIntegerThing, Entity::setIntegerThing);

    Connection connection = // create connection just as for your application

    try {
        Validator.validate(connection, daoBuilder);
    } catch (HrormException ex){
        System.out.println(ex.getMessage);
    }</pre>

                <p>The testing that this performs is light. It will <b>not</b> attempt to make any changes to the
                    state of the database. It will merely check to make sure the structures exist as expected.
                    Moreover, each <code>Dao</code> is tested individually. Related <code>Dao</code>
                    objects, even dependent child objects, are not checked by the <code>Validator</code>.</p>

            <h2>Daos</h2>

            <p>To create a <code>Dao</code> from a <code>DaoBuilder</code>, just pass it a
                <code>java.sql.Connection</code>:</p>

            <pre>
    // Assume the existence of some ConnectionPool
    Connection connection = ConnectionPool.connect();
    Dao&lt;Person&gt; dao = daoBuilder.buildDao(connection);</pre>

            <a name="insert"></a>
            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Insert</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>To create a new record in the database, we create a new instance of the class and pass it
                    to <code>Dao.insert()</code>.</p>

                <pre>
    Person person = new Person();
    // set values for the fields we want
    person.setName("Thomas Bartholomew Atkinson Wilberforce");
    person.setHighSchoolGraduate(true);
    person.setWeight(100L);
    long id = dao.insert(person);
    connection.commit();</pre>

                <p>After that code runs, the record will be stored in the database. Hrorm will have pulled
                    a new sequence value and set it on the object. The following assertions will be true. Note that for
                    immutable objects whose <code>Dao</code> implementations were created using an <code>IndirectDaoBuilder</code>
                    the ID will not be set.</p>

                <pre>
    Assert.assertNotNull(person.getId());
    Assert.assertTrue(id == person.getId());</pre>

                <h5>Children</h5>

                <p>Hrorm will automatically insert child records of the instance being saved, if any.</p>

                <h5>Siblings</h5>

                <p>If the record has sibling entities, references to those will be persisted. But be careful,
                    those sibling references must be persisted first. Sibling inserts and updates do not cascade.</p>

            </div>

            <a name="select"></a>
            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Select</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm provides a few methods for reading data out of the database and instantiating entity
                    objects.</p>

                <p>All of the selection mechanisms below will fully read and populate the entire relevant object graph
                    including all children and siblings and all their transitive references.</p>

                <h5>Primary Key</h5>

                <p>You can read an item from the database if you know its primary key.</p>

                <pre>
    Person person = dao.select(432L);</pre>

                <p>If you want to read several IDs at once, you can.</p>

                <pre>
    List&lt;Person&gt; personList = dao.selectMany(Arrays.asList(432L,21L,7659L));</pre>

                <h5>All Records</h5>

                <p>If you want all the records (presumably for a smallish table) just do</p>

                <pre>
    List&lt;Person&gt; personList = dao.selectAll();</pre>

                <h5>By Columns</h5>

                <p>Most of the time, you do not know up front what ID or IDs you are intersted in, so
                    hrorm allows you to select by columns. To do this, we make an instance of the entity
                    we are searching for and populate it with the values we want to match or compare to. Suppose we want
                    to find all the people who are high school graduates and that weigh more than 100 kilograms
                    and who have the string fragment "Bart" in their names. We start by creating an instance
                    of the entity with the critical values to be included in our query.</p>

                <pre>
    Person personTemplate = new Person();
    personTemplate.setHighSchoolGraduate(true);
    personTemplate.setWeight(100L);
    personTemplate.setName("%Bart%");</pre>

                <p>Then, we create a <code>Map</code> detailing what columns we are interested in and
                what comparisons to use when running the query.</p>

                <pre>
    Map&lt;String, Operator&gt; columnMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    columnMap.put("IS_HIGH_SCHOOL_GRADUATE", Operator.EQUALS);
    columnMap.put("WEIGHT", Operator.GREATER_THAN);
    columnMap.put("NAME", Operator.LIKE);</pre>

                <p>Now we are ready to query for all the matching records.</p>

                <pre>
    List&lt;Person&gt; people = personDao.selectManyByColumns(personTemplate, columnMap);</pre>

                <p>Notice that hrorm wants the names of the database <b>columns</b>, not the fields on the object.
                Also note that query generated will link the various parts of the where clause with "AND"s. The
                returned records will match all the specified criteria.</p>

                <p>In addition to the like, equals, and comparison operators, hrorm supports creating ranges
                for numeric and date types that support comparison. There are methods for both open and closed
                ranges. The value for the field in question set in the template object becomes the low end of
                the range, and the methods for creating the ranges accept the upper limit as an argument.</p>

                <p>If we want to find records using only the equals operator, hrorm provides a convenience
                method that does not require us to build the column name-operator map.</p>

                <pre>
    List&lt;Person&gt; people = personDao.selectManyByColumns(personTemplate, "IS_HIGH_SCHOOL_GRADUATE", "WEIGHT", "NAME");</pre>

                <p>If we know that a particular query will only return 0 or 1 results (for instance, if there is
                    a uniqueness constraint on the name field), hrorm provides a further convenience method for that.</p>

                <pre>
    Person personTemplate = new Person();
    personTemplate.setName("Rumplestiltskin");

    Person person = personDao.selectByColumns(personTemplate, "NAME");</pre>

                <p>If you use this method and hrorm finds more than one record, it will raise an exception.</p>

            </div>

            <a name="update"></a>
            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Update</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>After making changes to the state of the object, we can call</p>

                <pre>
    dao.update(person);
    connection.commit();</pre>

                <p>This will issue an update in the database based on the primary key (<code>id</code>) field.</p>

                <p>Updates will automatically propagate to children, but not to siblings.</p>

            </div>

            <a name="delete"></a>
            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Delete</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>When we are done with a person, we can issue</p>

                <pre>
    dao.delete(person);
    connection.commit();</pre>

                <p>To remove the record from the database, using the primary key, as with an update.</p>

                <p>Deletes will automatically propagate to children, but not to siblings.</p>

            </div>

            <a name="atomic"></a>
            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Atomic</h3>

                <p>In addition to the <code>insert</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code>
                    methods, hrorm <code>Dao</code> objects provide variants of those methods
                    called <code>atomicInsert</code>, <code>atomicUpdate</code>, and <code>atomicDelete</code>.
                    These are useful if you do not mind your changes being committed automatically. But they
                    cannot be used inside larger transactions. Additionally, these methods will close the
                    <code>Connection</code> object their enclosing <code>Dao</code> was built with.</p>

            </div>

            <a name="folding"></a>
            <div class="card fluid">
                <h3>Folding</h3>

                <p>Many ORMs (and other database connectivity tools) provide some mechanism for lazily
                    loading data. This is a useful feature since it's quite common to work on data sets
                    in your application that are too large for it.
                </p>

                <p>The biggest problem with this approach is that it can lead to peculiar bugs when
                    a connection is closed too early and something that was to be lazily loaded cannot be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hrorm's select methods are not lazy and so are only suitable for selecting limited
                    quantities of data. But, Hrorm does provide a way to run a select without instantiating
                    a list of all the found objects with the <code>Dao::foldingSelect</code> method.
                    This method allows a general select to be done, and then a flexible folding operation
                    to take place on the database's returned result set.
                </p>

                <p>At times, it might be more sensible to write the logic required as a select with a
                    group by clause. But at other times you cannot express the application logic necessary
                    in the database, and this facility exists for those times.

                <h3>SQL</h3>

                <p>The <code>SQL</code> that hrorm generates to make a <code>Dao</code> can be accessed by
                    calling the <code>queries()</code> method. The <code>SQL</code> is formatted
                    in a way suitable for passing to a <code>PreparedStatement</code> with embedded
                    question marks for variable substitution.</p>

                <p>You can also access a <code>Queries</code> object by calling <code>buildQueries()</code>
                    on a <code>DaoBuilder</code> object. This provides an identical instance, but does not
                    require a <code>Connection</code>, which building a <code>Dao</code> does.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm thinks that checked exceptions are a mistake. In an application with a database dependency,
                    you have three choices:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Have <code>SQLException</code> declared in most methods all over your application.</li>
                    <li>Try to handle <code>SQLException</code> somehow when doing interactions with
                        <code>Connection</code>,
                        <code>Statement</code>, and <code>ResultSet</code> objects, defeating the purpose of
                        exception handling being centralized and removed from normal application flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>Convert <code>SQLException</code> to some other type, descended from
                        <code>RuntimeException</code>.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Hrorm opts for method 3.
                </p>

                <p>Hrorm will throw a <code>HrormException</code> when it has a problem. If there was an underlying
                    <code>SQLException</code> that will be exposed on the <code>HrormException</code>.

                <h3>Logging</h3>

                <hr>

                <p>The state of Java logging is a tiny bit unfortunate.</p>

                <p>The <code>java.util.logging</code> package in the standard library is not widely
                    used. Unfortunately, rather than a set of pluggable interfaces, they provided a concrete
                    implementation.</p>

                <p>Log4j is pretty ubiquitous, but not universal. Additionally, hrorm currently has
                    no dependencies. It would be a shame to add one.</p>

                <p>Hrorm therefore uses <code>java.util.logging</code> implementation.
                    There are ways to redirect that to log4j and other logging frameworks.</p>

                <p>Hrorm logs to a logger named "org.hrorm" all the SQL it issues at INFO level.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="card fluid">

                <a name="visibility"></a>
                <h3>Visibility</h3>

                <hr>

                <p>Hrorm is designed to have a small surface area for clients. Most of the time, clients should only
                    need to interact with three hrorm types: <code>DaoBuilder</code>, <code>Dao</code>, and
                    <code>HrormException</code>. There are a few other types that a client may want to use,
                    but most of the classes in hrorm are internal to it.

                <p>In spite of this, almost all the classes in hrorm are public and contain public constructors
                    and methods. If you feel like instantiating a <code>JoinColumn</code> object, hrorm feels
                    no need to try to stop you.</p>

                <p>Most of the time, hrorm will point out in the Javadocs where classes are not
                    intended for clients to use directly.</p>
